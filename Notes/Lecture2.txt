Supervised learnng:
    Feed training set to a learnng algorithm, which outputs a function that outputs a hypothesis

    Structuring a ML algorithm is important:
        design choices of workflow, data set, hypothesis 

    A training dataset has a number of training examples
    X = Input variable/ feature
    y = Output or target variable; label
    (x,y) = 1 training example
    n = number of features

Linear regression
    Affine function
    Parameter and feature vectors
    cost function or squared error cost function
    learning rate

Batch/ stochastic gradient descent
Normal equation
