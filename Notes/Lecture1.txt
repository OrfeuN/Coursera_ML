Machine learning is a programme that learns from experience to perform a task "better" with that experience
    eg: checkers programme


Supervised learning:
    has a label (y)
    self-driving car
    depending on features (X1, X2, ...)
    can be regression (conntinuos) or classification (single or multiple buckets/ categories)
    predict price of houses based on sq footage (linear regression)
    support vector machine for infinite features

Unsupervised learning:
    grouping news
    marketing classification for clients
    cocktail problem
    no label

Deep learning
    neural networks

Reinforcement learning:
    training a dog is an analogy. Let the dog do its things: reward when it does well "good dog", punish for "bad" behaviour
    teaching a helicopter to fly
